Subject: Urgent Request for Forwarding LoRs to Universities

Dear CSE HOD,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your urgent assistance in forwarding my Letters of Recommendation (LoRs) to the universities I have applied to. As you are aware, the application deadlines are fast approaching, and it is crucial that my LoRs reach the universities on time.

I have already submitted the names and contact details of my recommenders to the universities. However, the LoRs need to be forwarded by the university's official email address for them to be considered valid. I kindly request you to forward these LoRs at the earliest possible opportunity.

I understand that this may require some additional work from your end, and I appreciate your help in this matter. The LoRs are essential components of my university applications, and their timely submission will significantly enhance my chances of being considered for admission.

I have attached the LoRs to this email for your convenience. If there are any issues with the attachments or if you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you in advance for your assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

(Your Name)
