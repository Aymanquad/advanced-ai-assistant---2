Subject: Request for Hackathon Conduction by GDG in the upcoming month

Dear CSE Staff,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you on behalf of the Google Developer Group (GDG) to request the opportunity to conduct a hackathon in the upcoming month.

Hackathons are a great way to bring together students and professionals in the field of computer science and technology. They provide a platform for participants to showcase their skills, collaborate with others, and learn new technologies in a fun and competitive environment.

We at GDG are passionate about promoting and supporting the developer community. We believe that hosting a hackathon at your esteemed institution will not only benefit the participants but also contribute to the growth and development of the community as a whole.

We propose to conduct a 24-hour hackathon, open to all students and professionals in the field of computer science and technology. The event will include keynote speeches, workshops, and mentoring sessions by industry experts. The participants will be divided into teams and will be given a set of challenges to solve using various technologies and tools.

We will take care of all the logistical arrangements, including the venue, food, and refreshments. We will also provide prizes and certificates for the winners and participants.

We believe that this hackathon will be a great opportunity for the participants to learn new skills, work on exciting projects, and network with like-minded individuals. We are confident that this event will have a positive impact on the community and help to promote the field of computer science and technology.

We would be grateful if you could consider our request and provide us with the necessary support and assistance. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best Regards,

Mohammed Ayman Quadri
