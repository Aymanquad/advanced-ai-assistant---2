Dear [CSE Staff Member's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am $MOHMMED AYMAN QUADRI, a content writer for GDG (Google Developers Group) and I am writing to request your support in conducting a hackathon event in the coming month.

GDG is an international community of developers, students, and IT professionals who are passionate about Google technology. Our mission is to empower and inspire developers to build innovative and impactful solutions. We believe that hackathons are an excellent platform for fostering creativity, collaboration, and learning among participants.

The hackathon we are planning to conduct will be a 24-hour event, during which participants will be tasked with developing solutions that address real-world problems using Google technology. The event will provide participants with an opportunity to showcase their skills, learn from experts, and network with like-minded individuals.

To ensure the success of the event, we require your support in the following areas:

1. Venue: We require a large space that can accommodate up to 200 participants, with access to power outlets, Wi-Fi, and other necessary amenities.
2. Equipment: We require projectors, screens, and other audiovisual equipment to facilitate presentations and workshops.
3. Mentors: We require experienced developers and IT professionals who can provide guidance and support to participants throughout the event.
4. Food and refreshments: We require catering services to provide meals and refreshments to participants during the event.
5. Promotion: We require your assistance in promoting the event to students, faculty, and staff members within the CSE department.

In return for your support, we will provide the following benefits:

1. Branding: We will prominently display your logo and name in all promotional materials, on the event website, and on social media platforms.
2. Networking: Your staff members will have the opportunity to network with talented and motivated students and professionals.
3. Learning: Your staff members can attend workshops and presentations delivered by industry experts, gaining valuable insights and knowledge.
4. Recruitment: You will have the opportunity to identify and recruit talented students and professionals for internships or full-time positions.

We believe that this hackathon event will be a great opportunity for the CSE department to showcase its commitment to innovation, learning, and community engagement. We would be grateful for your support in making this event a success.
