Subject: Request for Hackathon Conduction by GDG in the Coming Month

Dear [CSE Staff],

I hope this email finds you well. I am $MOHMMED AYMAN QUADRI, a content writer for GDG (Google Developer Group) and I am writing to request your support in conducting a hackathon in the coming month.

Hackathons are events where programmers and developers come together to collaborate on software projects. They provide an excellent opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience in coding, problem-solving, and teamwork. By hosting a hackathon at our institution, we can encourage and support the growth of the local developer community, as well as provide a platform for students to showcase their skills and talents.

We are proposing to hold the hackathon on [date] and are seeking your assistance in securing a suitable venue and promoting the event to students. We would also appreciate any guidance or resources you can provide in terms of organizing the event, such as judging criteria or sponsorship opportunities.

At GDG, we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive community of developers. We would like to ensure that the hackathon is open to all students, regardless of their background or experience level. We plan to offer workshops and mentoring sessions to help participants develop their skills and ideas, and to create a supportive and collaborative environment.

We believe that hosting a hackathon at our institution would be a valuable and exciting opportunity for students. We would be grateful for your support in making this event a success.

Thank you for considering our request. Please let us know if you have any questions or require further information.

Best regards,

$MOHMMED AYMAN QUADRI
