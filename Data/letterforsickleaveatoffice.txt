Subject: Request for Sick Leave

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am not feeling well and will not be able to come to work for the next few days. I woke up this morning with a high fever and other flu-like symptoms, and I believe it would be best for me to rest and recover at home.

I have already arranged for my responsibilities to be covered during my absence. [If applicable, mention the name of the colleague who will be handling your tasks.]

I will keep you updated on my progress and plan to return to work as soon as I am medically cleared. In the meantime, please let me know if there is anything else I need to do.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
