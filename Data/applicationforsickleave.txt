Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work for the next few days due to illness. I regret any inconvenience this may cause and I will make every effort to ensure that my absence has minimal impact on my duties and responsibilities.

I was diagnosed with [specific illness or medical condition] and was advised by my doctor to take a few days off to rest and recover. I am currently taking the prescribed medication and following the recommended treatment plan. I am confident that with proper rest and medical care, I will be back to work soon and ready to contribute my best efforts to the team.

In the meantime, I have taken steps to ensure that my work is covered during my absence. I have delegated my tasks to [colleague's name] and provided them with all the necessary information and resources to complete the work. I will also be available by email or phone to answer any questions or provide additional guidance if needed.

I appreciate your understanding and support during this time. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
